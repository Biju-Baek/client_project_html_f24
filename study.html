            <p>Study Spaces at U-M is a tool designed to help you find and reserve designated study spaces, computer stations, a space for you to take a remote class, or just a dedicated quiet touchdown spot between classes. <br> It's understandable that many might be anxious that there aren't many spaces on the site, after going through the last academic year where the primary method of accessing study space was to reserve.</p>
